                                    <p>Throughout a 10-week development cycle, I collaborated with a talented team of
                                        developers to create NewU InscribeX - a Web3 communication platform that bridges
                                        traditional social networking with blockchain technology. This project was
                                        sponsored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillipliusr/">Phillip Liu</a>

                                                from
                                                NewU's commitment to long-term use of Firebase despite its associated
                                                costs.</li>
                                            <li>Typescript to JavaScript translation remains a key challenge due to the
                                                current dependency on JavaScript and the dilemma of translating or
                                                transitioning fully to TypeScript.</li>

                                                significantly for the marketplace but is contingent on acquiring further

                                        <h3>UML Sequence Diagram</h3>
                                        <figure><img src="assets/images/NewU-InscribeX-img/image25.png"></figure>
                                        <p>
                                            This UML sequence diagram describes the important use case of communicating
                                            with other users.
                                            The main actor of this diagram is the user who must first login by
                                            connecting to their web3.0 wallet.
                                            Otherwise, the user is not able to communicate with other users and is only
                                            able to read messages from the global chat.
                                            The login is handled with an external extension which currently supports
                                            Unisat and OKX.
                                            A user’s login information, which consists of their wallet address and a
                                            temporary username, is stored inside Firebase.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            After the user is logged in, they are able to proceed to the community
                                            feature by selecting the Chat button in the header.
                                            The user is automatically able to view all the global chats and can now type
                                            a message to send to the global chat.
                                            Messages are sent to and stored inside Firebase. In addition, the user can
                                            now select another user’s avatar to add them as a friend or go to the friend
                                            tab inside the community page to add friends.
                                            Once another user has been added as a friend, an individual chat will open
                                            up to allow direct and private communication with the other user.
                                            The user’s friend(s) are stored inside Firebase.

                                        <figure><img src="assets/images/NewU-InscribeX-img/image7.png"></figure>
                                        <p>
                                            The database is a NoSQL design with Google’s Firebase as our database.
                                            Firebase operates as a collection of documents,
                                            and each document contains information similar to a SQL table’s rows
                                            containing information in columns.
                                            “By default, Cloud Firestore automatically maintains single-field indexes
                                            for each field in a document and each subfield in a map.” (Google Cloud)
                                            This characteristic helps for faster retrieval of data, which is one of the
                                            main reasons we chose this service as our database.
                                        </p>
                                        <figure><img src="assets/images/NewU-InscribeX-img/image23.png"></figure>
                                        <p>
                                            The <b>users’</b> table is where we store our user information. In Firebase,
                                            new
                                            entries are generated as documents and are automatically given a
                                            self-generated unique document for identification.
                                            Normally this value has no meaningful purpose other than for identification,
                                            but we’ve decided to make our own documentID.
                                            The characteristics of web3.0 wallet addresses are that they are unique.
                                            This is an important characteristic because no one wants their money to go
                                            into another’s wallet accidentally,
                                            both in virtual and in real life. This unique characteristic satisfies the
                                            same uniqueness characteristics of the documentID.
                                            With a known documentID, we can reach each user’s information faster instead
                                            of querying it.
                                            This is extremely convenient because when users log into their web3 wallet,
                                            the first set of information we receive contains the walletAddress.
                                            The users’ unique document is created upon their first login with their
                                            wallet. Each wallet will have its own account.
                                            While developing this table, one of the most important questions was how do
                                            we allow users to change their username and profile picture.
                                            There were two approaches to this problem, either we save it in one location
                                            and have API calls from other functions that require profile pictures and
                                            usernames, or we save it at all other tables like messages and update it
                                            periodically.
                                            Originally, we had the second approach since we were not going to include
                                            the update user information functionality until the end.
                                            As we approach the end of the development of the chat feature, we’re
                                            starting to tackle this problem. In discussion with our CTO, he suggested
                                            using the first approach to ensure the timeliness of the information.
                                            We’re currently at a 50% milestone on implementing this change. Our biggest
                                            setback is that the amount of API calls is too frequent.
                                            We want to implement a Redis cache system to save time and money from
                                            redundant API calls to the Firebase server.
                                            Currently, we’ve shifted towards finishing all the functionalities before
                                            coming back and optimizing with Redis.

                                            The <b>global</b> table is where we store all the message information for
                                            global
                                            chats. Currently, we are only using one global chat,
                                            but we have a vision that as we include more types of assets/cryptocurrency
                                            on our subnet, every coin type will have its community global chat.
                                            The global chats are documents that contain only one field, chatHistory, and
                                            documentID as the name.
                                            Since there is a set amount of global chats and users cannot freely create
                                            them, it is logical to use the name as the documentID.
                                            We are only storing chatHistory because, by the definition of global chat,
                                            everyone can type in it.
                                            There isn’t a meaningful purpose in storing a list of users or other
                                            information as it will also slow down the database that is already in high
                                            demand.
                                            This is not currently a big issue right now, but as the number of users
                                            increases, it will slow down the loading time of the chat page if every user
                                            needs to be displayed for each global chat.
                                            The chatHistory is an array of messages with the format indicated by the
                                            message table in the diagram.
                                            For future development, there are plans to store only the key identification
                                            walletAddress in the message object,
                                            but it is in low priority since the mass amount of messages in the global
                                            chat would already dilute the significance of who wrote the message.
                                            In addition, it is also not realistic to implement until a cache system is
                                            set up where usernames and profile pictures are easily and cheaply acquired.

                                        <p>
                                            Moving on to the <b>messages</b> table which is a placeholder for a message
                                            object, we can use it to further develop and brainstorm ideas for creating
                                            different types of chats. By default, the database has a single global chat
                                            to which everyone has access to. Each individual message object has a few
                                            key attributes that simplify development, with one of them being the user.
                                            The user attribute of the message class allows for the identification of the
                                            sender. This facilitates UI features such as displaying who sent the
                                            message, querying the user instance for things like the avatar and username
                                            to display, and, later on, the creation of a friends list for each user.
                                            Similar to the reasoning for keeping track of a username, we also store the
                                            wallet address associated with each message sent. This ensures that when
                                            creating relationships between users, there will always be a unique
                                            identifier to differentiate and verify security. Otherwise, if multiple
                                            people have the same username, we can not accurately determine which user
                                            they want to add friends with. Other attributes of the message class include
                                            text, which is the actual content of the message sent, timestamp, which is
                                            the time the message was sent, and id, allowing for the identification of
                                            malicious messages later on in development.
                                        </p>
                                        <figure><img src="assets/images/NewU-InscribeX-img/image2.png"></figure>
                                        <p>For the <b>friendsList</b> table, there are two attributes each allowing for
                                            key functionalities related to different types of messaging and later on
                                            direct trading. The unique identifier is the walletAddress which relates a
                                            friendsList collection back to its respective user instance. The second
                                            attribute is the friend's walletAddress, which allows the identification of
                                            each friend within the list. This structure enables the system to
                                            efficiently manage and retrieve a user’s friends, facilitating the creation
                                            of private chats and enabling direct transactions between users. Each entry
                                            in the friendList table represents a unique relationship between the user
                                            and their friends, which provides a foundation for personalized
                                            communication and trading features. The user’s friendsList document is
                                            generated at their first login and the friendList field updates upon adding
                                            more users as friends.
                                        </p>
                                        <figure><img src="assets/images/NewU-InscribeX-img/image8.png"></figure>
                                        <p>
                                            Once the friendList table has been created, the user can now create their
                                            own chat room. This is related to the <b>individualChat</b> table. The
                                            chatID is generated through the combination of the walletAddress of users
                                            involved in a direct message. The messages here are stored in an array of
                                            message objects referenced through their unique associated id. Both of these
                                            design decisions allow for the messages to be managed more efficiently for
                                            both users. After this class, it will facilitate the development of features
                                            such as deleting or editing a message. Despite the name individualChat, an
                                            instance of this class would also store a userList which is an array of
                                            users. This allows the individualChat class to be reused for instances that
                                            require a group chat. However, where they differ is the creation of an
                                            instance of a groupChat instance. Individual documents are created upon
                                            friend adds, the chatID will also serve as the documentID since two unique
                                            values concatenated have a low chance of becoming non-unique. This means
                                            that a unique individual chat conversation is created whenever a new user is
                                            added as a friend. For future development, developers should look into valid
                                            walletAddress characters and find a character that walletAddress will not
                                            have and is accepted by Firebase as documentID and insert it in between the
                                            two walletAddress to ensure uniqueness.
                                        </p>

                                            The <b>groupChatList</b> table is designed to manage and organize group
                                            chats within the website’s Chat Page. Each entry in the table is linked to a
                                            specific user through their unique walletAddress, which serves as the
                                            primary identifier. This structure allows the system to efficiently track
                                            and manage the group chats for each individual user. Within the
                                            groupChatList table, the walletAddress attribute ties the back to the
                                            respective user instance in the users table. The groupChatList attribute is
                                            an array that holds multiple chatID values, each representing a unique group
                                            chat that the user is a member of. These chatID values are linked to the
                                            groupChat table, where each chatID corresponds to a specific group chat
                                            entry.
                                        </p>

                                            Lastly, the <b>groupChat</b> table is utilized to differentiate between a
                                            group chat and an individual chat. It includes attributes such as chatID,
                                            chatHistory, userList, and name. The chatID is a unique identifier for each
                                            group chat, generated through a library called UUID and a chatHistory
                                            attribute utilized similarly to individual chat. The charHistory is an array
                                            of message objects. Each message object contains details like the sender's
                                            walletAddress, the text of the message, the timestamp, the user, and unique
                                            message id.

                                            The User Flow Diagram illustrates the navigation paths within an application
                                            starting from the initial page.
                                            The process begins at the "Start" point and transitions to the "Home Page."
                                            From the "Home Page," users can navigate to several different pages:
                                            Staking Page, Borrow Land Page, Chat Page, BTCGPT Page. When a user
                                            navigates to the "Chat Page," the page is only readable by default, which
                                            restricts chat functionality until the user logs in.
                                            To gain full access to chat features, the user must go through the "Login
                                            Page" and connect their wallet.

                                            At the "Wallet Connected" decision point: If the wallet is connected
                                            ("Yes"), the user is able to chat and view the "Friend List" page,
                                            granting full access to chat and friend list functionalities. If the wallet
                                            is not connected ("No"), the user is redirected back to the "Chat readable
