                                            <li>Firebase is now required for data storage. This decision stems from
                                                NewU's commitment to long-term use of Firebase despite its associated
                                                costs.</li>
                                            <li>Typescript to JavaScript translation remains a key challenge due to the
                                                current dependency on JavaScript and the dilemma of translating or
                                                transitioning fully to TypeScript.</li>
                                            <li>The team has limited experience in frontend design, creating challenges
                                                in the current development phase.</li>
                                            <li>The provided Figma design, developed by another team, is assumed to meet
                                                the sponsor's requirements and largely align with the final design
                                                vision.</li>
                                            <li>Integration of the Avalanche Subnet is anticipated to reduce gas fees
                                                significantly for the marketplace but is contingent on acquiring further
                                                understanding of the Avalanche API.</li>
                                            <li>All login and chat features are assumed to be centralized, despite
                                                discussions around decentralization.</li>
                                            <li>Chinese users will be able to access the app using a VPN, even though
                                                Firebase is banned in China.</li>
                                            <li>Desktop Chrome is assumed to be the primary platform for users,
                                                simplifying development and leveraging Chrome's extensive extensions.

                                        <h3>UML Sequence Diagram</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            This UML sequence diagram describes the important use case of communicating
                                            with other users.
                                            The main actor of this diagram is the user who must first login by
                                            connecting to their web3.0 wallet.
                                            Otherwise, the user is not able to communicate with other users and is only
                                            able to read messages from the global chat.
                                            The login is handled with an external extension which currently supports
                                            Unisat and OKX.
                                            A user’s login information, which consists of their wallet address and a
                                            temporary username, is stored inside Firebase.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            After the user is logged in, they are able to proceed to the community
                                            feature by selecting the Chat button in the header.
                                            The user is automatically able to view all the global chats and can now type
                                            a message to send to the global chat.
                                            Messages are sent to and stored inside Firebase. In addition, the user can
                                            now select another user’s avatar to add them as a friend or go to the friend
                                            tab inside the community page to add friends.
                                            Once another user has been added as a friend, an individual chat will open
                                            up to allow direct and private communication with the other user.
                                            The user’s friend(s) are stored inside Firebase.

                                        <h3>Database Design</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            The database is a NoSQL design with Google’s Firebase as our database.
                                            Firebase operates as a collection of documents,
                                            and each document contains information similar to a SQL table’s rows
                                            containing information in columns.
                                            “By default, Cloud Firestore automatically maintains single-field indexes
                                            for each field in a document and each subfield in a map.” (Google Cloud)
                                            This characteristic helps for faster retrieval of data, which is one of the
                                            main reasons we chose this service as our database.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The users’ table is where we store our user information. In Firebase, new
                                            entries are generated as documents and are automatically given a
                                            self-generated unique document for identification.
                                            Normally this value has no meaningful purpose other than for identification,
                                            but we’ve decided to make our own documentID.
                                            The characteristics of web3.0 wallet addresses are that they are unique.
                                            This is an important characteristic because no one wants their money to go
                                            into another’s wallet accidentally,
                                            both in virtual and in real life. This unique characteristic satisfies the
                                            same uniqueness characteristics of the documentID.
                                            With a known documentID, we can reach each user’s information faster instead
                                            of querying it.
                                            This is extremely convenient because when users log into their web3 wallet,
                                            the first set of information we receive contains the walletAddress.
                                            The users’ unique document is created upon their first login with their
                                            wallet. Each wallet will have its own account.
                                            While developing this table, one of the most important questions was how do
                                            we allow users to change their username and profile picture.
                                            There were two approaches to this problem, either we save it in one location
                                            and have API calls from other functions that require profile pictures and
                                            usernames, or we save it at all other tables like messages and update it
                                            periodically.
                                            Originally, we had the second approach since we were not going to include
                                            the update user information functionality until the end.
                                            As we approach the end of the development of the chat feature, we’re
                                            starting to tackle this problem. In discussion with our CTO, he suggested
                                            using the first approach to ensure the timeliness of the information.
                                            We’re currently at a 50% milestone on implementing this change. Our biggest
                                            setback is that the amount of API calls is too frequent.
                                            We want to implement a Redis cache system to save time and money from
                                            redundant API calls to the Firebase server.
                                            Currently, we’ve shifted towards finishing all the functionalities before
                                            coming back and optimizing with Redis.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The global table is where we store all the message information for global
                                            chats. Currently, we are only using one global chat,
                                            but we have a vision that as we include more types of assets/cryptocurrency
                                            on our subnet, every coin type will have its community global chat.
                                            The global chats are documents that contain only one field, chatHistory, and
                                            documentID as the name.
                                            Since there is a set amount of global chats and users cannot freely create
                                            them, it is logical to use the name as the documentID.
                                            We are only storing chatHistory because, by the definition of global chat,
                                            everyone can type in it.
                                            There isn’t a meaningful purpose in storing a list of users or other
                                            information as it will also slow down the database that is already in high
                                            demand.
                                            This is not currently a big issue right now, but as the number of users
                                            increases, it will slow down the loading time of the chat page if every user
                                            needs to be displayed for each global chat.
                                            The chatHistory is an array of messages with the format indicated by the
                                            message table in the diagram.
                                            For future development, there are plans to store only the key identification
                                            walletAddress in the message object,
                                            but it is in low priority since the mass amount of messages in the global
                                            chat would already dilute the significance of who wrote the message.
                                            In addition, it is also not realistic to implement until a cache system is
                                            set up where usernames and profile pictures are easily and cheaply acquired.

                                            The User Flow Diagram illustrates the navigation paths within an application
                                            starting from the initial page.
                                            The process begins at the "Start" point and transitions to the "Home Page."
                                            From the "Home Page," users can navigate to several different pages:
                                            Staking Page, Borrow Land Page, Chat Page, BTCGPT Page. When a user
                                            navigates to the "Chat Page," the page is only readable by default, which
                                            restricts chat functionality until the user logs in.
                                            To gain full access to chat features, the user must go through the "Login
                                            Page" and connect their wallet.

                                            At the "Wallet Connected" decision point: If the wallet is connected
                                            ("Yes"), the user is able to chat and view the "Friend List" page,
                                            granting full access to chat and friend list functionalities. If the wallet
                                            is not connected ("No"), the user is redirected back to the "Chat readable
                                            only" page.
